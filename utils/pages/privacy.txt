# Privacy Policy

xi.pe is a public pastebin service operated by Drew Streib (dtype@dtype.org). By
using this service, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

## Public Access
All content you post is publicly accessible to anyone with the relevant URL.

## Data Collection
For security purposes, we collect IP addresses when content is posted. This
information is not displayed to end users. IP addresses are retained only as long
as the posted content (1 week or as posted on the submission form). This site does
not collect identifying information otherwise, although such information may be
present in user-submitted content.

Cookies are used only to provide a convenience mechanism to grant a user the
ability to delete the content that they submitted. By default, a cookie will allow
this to happen from the browser used for the submission. This cookie has no further
user-identifying information.

## Cloudflare
This site uses Cloudflare as a caching and application firewall frontend. We may
use Cloudflare-injected cookies for firewall tracking purposes to assist with bot
detection and security. We may also use Cloudflare-injected javascript to separate
humans from increasingly aggressive bots that otherwise cause site stability
issues.

We do not perform raw http log collection with Cloudflare, and any non-aggregated
Cloudflare security data is kept for a maximum of 7 days.

## License Grant
You grant xi.pe and its operator a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to
use, display, distribute, and make available any content you post.

## User Responsibility
You are solely responsible for ensuring you have the legal right to post any
content. Do not post content you do not own or lack permission to share.

## No Warranties
xi.pe provides this service "as is" without any warranties or guarantees. We act
solely as a hosting platform for user-generated content.

## Your Rights
If you believe posted content violates your rights, email abuse@xi.pe for prompt
resolution. You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of
your personal data. You may also lodge complaints with your local data protection
authority.

By using xi.pe, you accept these terms.
