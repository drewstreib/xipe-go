## Public Access
All content you post is publicly accessible to anyone with the relevant URL.

## Data Collection
For security purposes, we collect IP addresses when content is posted. This
information is not displayed to end users. IP addresses are retained only as
long as the posted content (up to 1 month, selectable by user). This site does
not collect identifying information otherwise, although such information may
be present in user-submitted content.

Cookies are used only to provide a convenience mechanism for a posting user to
be granted the right to delete the content that they submitted. By default, a
cookie will allow this to happen from the browser used for the submission.
This cookie has no further user-identifying information.

## License Grant
You grant xi.pe and its operator a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license
to use, display, distribute, and make available any content you post.

## User Responsibility
You are solely responsible for ensuring you have the legal right to post any
content. Do not post content you do not own or lack permission to share.

## No Warranties
xi.pe provides this service "as is" without any warranties or guarantees. We
act solely as a hosting platform for user-generated content.

## Copyright Concerns
If you believe posted content violates your rights, email abuse@xi.pe for
prompt resolution.

## Your Rights
You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your
personal data. You may also lodge complaints with your local data protection
authority.

By using xi.pe, you accept these terms.
